# Surface_Duo_2_GCam

Google Camera (GCam) for the Microsoft Surface Duo 2. These are the notes I collected while trying out several GCam mods on my Surface Duo. The here noted infoâ€™s are probably incomplete and may not work on other devices, as my focus is only the Surface Duo 2. 

I am not the developer of the here listed GCam Ports!


## Current status

I will try to regulary update the config if i make some noticable improvements or changes.
Going forward, i recommend to stay on the LMC R15 GCam Port for now, as i probably won't maintain both AGC and LMC configs.
Current configs can be downloaded from the Release page to the right, while additional informations regarding the Settings and so on can be found in the Wiki page.


## Recommended GCam Port

LMC 8.4 R18 by Hasli (Based on Google Camera 8.4)

[LMC8.4_R18F1_Google_Lens.apk](https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/dev-hasli/f/dl14/)

I recommend this Package as it enables the Google Lens feature under Modes.

Please check out the release page for the additional required xml settings file.

## Notes

If you find better settings for the Surface Duo 2 GCam, please let me know and I will make an update here (just make a pull request).


Additional Note regarding GCam 8.6 and newer versions:

While there are some GCam Ports of the current Google Camera version 8.7 (and newer like 9.1), these are still early builds. They all have UI bugs or bugs while capturing HDR+/Night Sight images. I recommend staying on this Port for now, as it is the most stable and functional GCam Build on the Surface Duo 2.
