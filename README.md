# Surface_Duo_2_GCam

Google Camera (GCam) for the Microsoft Surface Duo 2. These are the notes I collected while trying out several GCam mods on my Surface Duo. The here noted infoâ€™s are probably incomplete and may not work on other devices, as my focus is only the Surface Duo 2. 

I am not the developer of the here listed GCam Ports!


## Current status

I will try to regulary update the config if i make some noticable improvements or changes.
Going forward, i recommend to stay on the LMC R15 GCam Port for now, as i probably won't maintain both AGC and LMC configs.
Current configs can be downloaded from the Release page to the right, while additional informations regarding the Settings and so on can be found in the Wiki page.


## Recommended GCam Port

LMC R15 by Hasli (Based on Google Camera 8.4)

[LMC8.4_R15_glens.apk](https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/dev-hasli/f/dl11/)

(I recommend the following Package as it enables the Google Lens feature under Modes


## Notes

If you find better settings for the Surface Duo 2 GCam, please let me know and I will make an update here (just make a pull request).


Additional Note Regarding GCam 8.6 or 8.7:

While there are some GCam Ports of the current Google Camera version 8.7, these are still early builds. They all have the problem, that they don't save an image if you take Night Sight or HDR+Enhanced images. The setting, which will fix this bug (Skip Metadata Check) isn't currently available on these early builds.
